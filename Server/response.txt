  OVERALL SCORE:           85

FIRST IMPRESSION:
  A visually striking, high-effort themed portfolio that immediately signals strong frontend capabilities and a passion for modern, immersive web aesthetics.

STRENGTHS:
  1. Cohesive and memorable 'cyberpunk' branding that demonstrates high-level CSS/UI skill.
  2. Clear tech stack identification, making it easy for recruiters to match skills like React, Next.js, and TypeScript.
  3. Strong project visualization with accessible links to live demos and source code.

WEAKNESSES:
  1. The niche aesthetic, while impressive, may prioritize form over function for recruiters looking for standard corporate readability.
  2. Work experience descriptions focus more on tasks than on quantifiable business impact or metrics.

SUGGESTIONS:
  1. Include a prominent link to a downloadable PDF version of the resume for ATS and recruiter convenience.
  2. Ensure all interactive elements meet accessibility (WCAG) standards, as high-contrast neon themes can sometimes present readability issues.
  3. Add more specific metrics to project descriptions, such as 'improved load time by X%' or 'scaled to X users'.

LLM ASSESSMENT:
  The portfolio is a standout example of creative frontend engineering, successfully using a specific subculture aesthetic to showcase technical proficiency. While the design is top-tier for creative or Web3-focused roles, adding more data-driven results to the experience section would make it more compelling for senior-level enterprise positions.
